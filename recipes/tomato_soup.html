        <h2>Description</h2>
        New Jersey is a well-known producer of tomatoes. Having our own garden leaves us with an abundance at the end of the season. Not wanting the tomatoes to go to waste, Hubby and I came up with our favorite version of tomato soup.

    <p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>7 cup, peeled seeded chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup of finely chopped onions</li>
            <li>1 can chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring the tomatoes, carrots, and onion to a boil over medium-high heat in a stockpot, then reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer for 30 minutes. Stir in the chicken broth, sugar, and salt.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter over medium-low heat in a small saucepan. Whisk in the flour, stirring until thick. Slowly whisk in the milk until smooth. Cook and stir, whisking constantly until thickened, about 5 minutes, then stir milk mixture in to the stockpot. Season with basil, celery salt, black pepper, and garlic powder. Continue to simmer the soup on low to reduce and thicken, about 1 hour.</li>       
        </ol>
